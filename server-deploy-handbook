Stages for deploying update GitHub master branch

Go to: https://srv1.poly.rpi.edu/ui/#/host/vms/36 on Cisco VPN using vpn.rpi.edu network

Ask Polytechnic for root login and password

Got to Dokku virtual machine and launch console

Login with creditials from the Polytechnic

Enter:
sudo -i #access admin rights
[Poly password]

cd home/poly/pipeline #directory with .git files 
git pull #will update the remote master branch with the GitHub master branch

git merge dokku/master
If changes don't appear reverse detached HEAD using 
"git reset --hard"
"git checkout master"

To check status of HEAD: "git rev-parse --short HEAD"

Other useful debug commands:

git status # displays the most recent commit made
git show # shows movement of HEAD along with previous commits
git fetch # fetches changes from GitHub master without merging
git log # shows activity of recent commits
